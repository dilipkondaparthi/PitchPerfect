# PitchPerfect

This project takes a user created sound and then applies four audio changes - speed up, slow down, chipmunk, and darth vader.
The optional extra tasks were pause and resume the recording, and two audio changes - reverb and echo.

The app includes all 6 audio effects and it now incorporates persistance. 
The app checks to see if a previous recording has been made. 
If it has, the app automatically launches the PlaySoundsViewController allowing the user to play the recording.
Returning to the RecordSoundsViewController the user can either record a new sound (this will overwrite any previous recordings) or they can choose to replay the previous recording.
